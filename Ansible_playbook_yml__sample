PLAYBOOK INTRO
==============
> Playbook is a single YAML file, containing one or more â€˜playsâ€™ in a list.

-> Plays are ordered sets of tasks to execute against host servers from your inventory file.

-> Play defines a set of activities (tasks) to be run on hosts.

-> Task is an action to be perform on the host

Examples are 

 a) Execute a command
 b) Run a shell script
 c) Install a package
 d) Shutdown/Restart the hosts


Note : Playbooks start with the YAML three dashes (---) and end with â€¦

-> Each play has first hosts, variables, and tasks


FileName: pingServers.yml
---------------------------------------
---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  remote_user: anisble
  tasks:
   - name : Test connection
     ping:
     remote_user: ansible


#hosts: The tasks will be executing in specified group of servers.

#name: which is the task name that will appear in your terminal when you run the playbook. 

#remote_user: This parameter was formerly called just user. It was renamed in Ansible 1.4 to make it more distinguishable from the user module (used to create users on remote systems).

Note : Remote users can also be defined per task.

$ ansible-playbook <<Playbbok file name>>

# It will run the samplePlayBook.yml playbook in verbose
